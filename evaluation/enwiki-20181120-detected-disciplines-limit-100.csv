Molecular pathology,"Molecular pathology. Molecular pathology is an emerging discipline within pathology which is focused in the study and diagnosis of disease through the examination of molecules within organs, tissues or bodily fluids. Molecular pathology shares some aspects of practice with both anatomic pathology and clinical pathology, molecular biology, biochemistry, proteomics and genetics, and is sometimes considered a ""crossover"" discipline.",1,0.996
Optics,"Optics. Optics is the branch of physics which involves the behaviour and properties of light, including its interactions with matter and the construction of instruments that use or detect it. Optics usually describes the behaviour of visible, ultraviolet, and infrared light. Because light is an electromagnetic wave, other forms of electromagnetic radiation such as X-rays, microwaves, and radio waves exhibit similar properties.",1,0.996
Stratigraphy,Stratigraphy. Stratigraphy is a branch of geology concerned with the study of rock layers (strata) and layering (stratification). It is primarily used in the study of sedimentary and layered volcanic rocks. Stratigraphy has two related subfields: lithostratigraphy (lithologic stratigraphy) and biostratigraphy (biologic stratigraphy).,1,0.996
Ecological anthropology,"Ecological anthropology. Ecological anthropology is a sub-field of anthropology and is defined as the ""study of cultural adaptations to environments"". The sub-field is also defined as, ""the study of relationships between a population of humans and their biophysical environment"". The focus of its research concerns ""how cultural beliefs and practices helped human populations adapt to their environments, and how people used elements of their culture to maintain their ecosystems"".",1,0.996
