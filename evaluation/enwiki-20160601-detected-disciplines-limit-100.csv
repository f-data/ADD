Computational finance,Computational finance. Computational finance is a branch of applied computer science that deals with problems of practical interest in finance. Some slightly different definitions are the study of data and algorithms currently used in finance and the mathematics of computer programs that realize financial models or systems. Computational finance emphasizes practical numerical methods rather than mathematical proofs and focuses on techniques that apply directly to economic analyses.,1,0.996
Computational economics,"Computational economics. Computational economics is a research discipline at the interface of computer science, economics, and management science. Areas and subjects encompassed include computational modeling of economic systems, whether agent-based, general-equilibrium, macroeconomic, or rational-expectations, computational econometrics and statistics, computational finance, computational tools for the designof automated internet markets, programming tools specifically designed for computational economics, and pedagogical tools for the teaching of computational economics.",1,0.996
